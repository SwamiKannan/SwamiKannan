<div align="center">Over the past 13 years, I have worked across the developing world, travelling to interesting countries, meeting fantastic people and sharing their stories. Over this time, I began to really appreciate the power of technology and specifically, AI & ML in the professional world. This is my first step into a fantastic journey </div>  <br>
 

🌱 I’m currently exploring Latent Diffusion Models (e.g. Stable Diffusion) and speech-to-text (e.g. Whisper)
  

❓ Ask me about anything related to process optimization, operations and analytics  
  

⚡ Inspired by: Machines that better learn to represent the real-world, people that drive creativity and flow
